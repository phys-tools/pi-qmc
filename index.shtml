        <p>This is a quantum simulation program from the 
        <a href="http://shumway.physics.asu.edu">Shumway Research Group</a>, 
        which focuses on applications to nanoscience and technology. 
        Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulates particles (often electrons and ions) by 
        directly sampling the canonical partition function. In the path integral formulation of 
        quantum statistical mechanics developed by Richard Feynman, particles get represented by 
        closed imaginary-time trajectories of length ℏ/kT. PIMC simulations are able to compute 
        total energies, correlation functions, charge distribution, and linear response functions 
        for thermal equilibrium. As in many quantum Monte Carlo methods, PIMC has efficient scaling 
        with system size, often order N<sup>2</sup> or N<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>Our application, <b><em>pi</em></b> or pi-qmc, is well-suited for modeling conduction electrons 
and holes in quantum dots, quantum wires, and quantum wells. 
For quantum dots and wires, we often generate realistic confining potentials using qdot-tools. 
We are also testing and developing pi for ab initio calculations, but at this point only hydrogen 
and helium systems work well.</p>

<p>To get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>To download the code, just download the zip file or use git. </li>
<li>This is an active research code, so all versions are development (beta), and we highly recommend 
using git for easy updates.</li>
<li>The pi user and reference manual is available online and in the doc/manual/ 
subdirectory of the source distribution.</li>
<li>See the wiki page on how to build the pi code.</li>
<li>There is an overview of PIMC on the wiki (in progress).</li>
<li>There is a list of current applications on the wiki (in progress).</li>
<li>To test out pi without downloading or installing anything, try out the online nanoHUB tool.</li>
</ul><p>Please send me your feedback: <a href="mailto:john.shumway@asu.edu">john.shumway@asu.edu</a>. 
This is my group's primary research code. 
Most of my efforts go towards our group research needs and collaborative science projects, 
but I'm making this code public to help everyone. 
Path integrals are fun, and I think a lot of interesting research can be enabled with some cooperation. 
I like to hear from other scientists, either via email or on the issues page. 
Instructional or tutorial material is much easier to justify if people document their interests. 
New developers are welcome to join this project.</p>
